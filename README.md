# react-webpack-todo-list

A Todo List implemented in React, built using Webpack. Intention is to learn how to build React-JSX-ES6 apps using Webpack, and to learn react-router, redux, redux-form.

The `boilerplate` branch contains the bare minimum code required to render a dummy unordered list using React, ES6, JSX and Webpack, rendered using the webpack-dev-server. This can be a good starting point to quickly write JSX code.

Attention will be paid to add the bare minimum dependencies and webpack config, to get things working.

Starting the dev server:

    npm install
    npm start

Accessing the App:

  http://localhost:4000/todo-list
